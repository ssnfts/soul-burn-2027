"""
A field of cars running a lap, and the shots that cover it.

Two jobs, kept apart because they fail differently. Putting cars on the circuit
is arithmetic — arc length along a closed spine — and it is either right or
obviously wrong. Choosing where the camera goes is not arithmetic, and the only
way to know a shot works is to look at it.

This module is pure: it computes where things are, and something else writes
keys. That split is why the same functions serve both a still-per-shot render
and a fully keyed scene.

**Speed comes from the circuit's own shape, not from a clock.** The first
version advanced every car at a constant arc-length rate. It was honest about
being blocking, and it also looked dead — constant speed is linear motion, and
a hairpin taken at the same rate as the back straight reads as a train on rails.
Speed is now grip-limited per corner (``v = sqrt(a_lat * R)``) and then swept
backwards for braking and forwards for traction, which is how a lap simulation
is built. The braking zone lands *before* the corner because the arithmetic puts
it there, and ease-in/ease-out fall out of the physics rather than being chosen.

Checked against the world: **80.7 s** against a real 2021 pole of **82.1 s** on
this layout, 1.7% quick. See :func:`curvature_radius` for why that agreement
should be read with care — the curvature baseline was fixed after the lap times
were seen, so it corroborates rather than independently confirms.

An earlier version of this note claimed 78.1 s and called it a good match. It
was not: the circumradius was being computed as ``abc/(2A)`` instead of
``abc/(4A)``, so every radius came out double and every corner was taken sqrt(2)
too fast. Two errors were partially cancelling, and the plausible answer hid
both. It took a test fixture built at a known radius to see it.

It is still blocking. There is no driver, no traffic, no tyre model and no
racing line — cars follow the centre-line, where a real driver straightens every
corner — so the number should not be quoted as a lap time.

Gaps between cars are in **seconds**, not metres. That is what a real interval
is, and it is why the pack stretches on the straights and closes up in the slow
corners; spacing by distance does the opposite, which is instantly wrong to
anyone who has watched a race.

    Body orientation as a quaternion ``(w, x, y, z)``.

    Composed here rather than handed to 3ds Max as Euler angles, because Max's
    Euler convention cost this project two real bugs that a render showed only
    as "the cars look wrong":

    * ``EulerAngles(0, 0, -heading)`` produced the **mirrored** rotation. A car
      keyed at heading 90 pointed west. Measured off the node's transform, not
      guessed: its local Y axis came back as ``[-1, 0, 0]``.
    * Pitch and roll were applied about the **world** axes rather than the car's
      own. At heading 90 a 3 degree roll tilted the body about world Y, which is
      pitch as far as the car is concerned. This is invisible while yaw is small
      and wrong everywhere else — an earlier comment here claimed the difference
      was below what a frame shows, and that was only true near heading 0.

    Composing the quaternion in Python makes the convention explicit and, more
    usefully, testable without a running 3ds Max: the nose direction for any
    heading is arithmetic, checkable against ``(sin h, cos h)``.

    Intrinsic Z-X-Y: yaw about the world up axis first, then pitch about the
    car's own lateral axis, then roll about its own nose axis. That order is
    what makes pitch and roll mean "nose down" and "lean" regardless of which

    Radius of the circle through each vertex and a neighbour either side.

    ``baseline_m`` is how far along the path those neighbours are taken from,

    anywhere from 2 m to 266 m apart, and a circumradius measured across two
    *adjacent* vertices on a densely-sampled bend reads the sampling noise as
    curvature: it returned 6 m radii on a Formula 1 corner, which no car has
    ever taken. Stepping out to a fixed arc length measures the corner instead
    of the digitisation.

    12 m is chosen on geometric grounds: it recovers a 22 m tightest radius on
    this circuit, against a real turn-7 hairpin of roughly 25 m. **Disclosure,
    because the ordering matters:** a sweep of 6/12/18/25/35 m was run and the

    computed a negative height and put the camera underground, which the
    below-site guard caught only at build time. A shot should not have to know
    where it sits in the lap.
