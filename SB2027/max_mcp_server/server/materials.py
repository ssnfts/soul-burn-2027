"""
OSM tags -> V-Ray materials.

OSM already carries material hints — ``building:material``, ``roof:material``,
``building`` type — so massing does not have to arrive uniformly grey. These are
procedural ``VRayMtl`` definitions with no texture dependencies: Chaos Cosmos
assets download on demand and are not guaranteed present, so they can be an
enhancement but never a requirement.

**Every parameter name here was read from a live VRayMtl**, not recalled. That
matters more for materials than for most things, because until this was fixed
the bridge could not tell a real attribute from a typo: a material's colour
parameters are not in ``getPropNames``, so they are reached with ``setattr``,
and ``setattr`` on a pymxs wrapper accepts any name at all while ``getattr``
reads it straight back. A probe with ``bogus_param_xyz`` reported itself
applied. The handler now checks ``hasattr`` first and returns a ``rejected``
map, so a misspelled parameter is loud instead of silently defaulted.

**Materials are shared, not per-building.** A thousand footprints must not
become a thousand VRayMtl instances — that bloats the scene, slows the viewport
and makes a later look-development pass impossible. :func:`group_by_material`
collapses them to one material per distinct tag, typically fewer than ten.
