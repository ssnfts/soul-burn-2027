"""
Scene assembly in 3ds Max — sun, sky and camera exposure.

V-Ray parameter names here are **discovered from the live host**, never
hardcoded. Chaos renames and adds sun/sky parameters between releases (the sky
cloud parameters especially), and MaxScript assignment to a property that does
not exist is silently ignored — producing a default-lit render with no error
anywhere to explain it. :func:`discover_vray` reads what actually exists;
writes go through the bridge's ``node_set``, which refuses unknown names.

Sun placement drives the ``VRaySun`` transform directly rather than going
through the 3ds Max Sun Positioner: Sun Positioner is not reliably honoured by
V-Ray, whereas a transform is deterministic and independently testable.
