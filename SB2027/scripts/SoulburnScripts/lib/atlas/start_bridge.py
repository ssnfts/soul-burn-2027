"""
Launcher for the Atlas bridge.

Exists so the bridge can be started from the **MAXScript** listener, which is
the one that opens by default, without fighting MaxScript string quoting:

    python.ExecuteFile @"<path-to-repo>\\bridge\\start_bridge.py"

From the Python listener you can equally just import atlas_max_bridge directly.

Either way this must run on the main thread — the bridge registers its
MaxScript tickCallback here, and a callback registered off the main thread
is unreliable in Max 2025+.
