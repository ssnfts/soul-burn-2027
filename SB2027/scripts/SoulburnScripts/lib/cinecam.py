"""
Camera moves, built from named techniques rather than from start/end pairs.

Every camera in this edit was a straight line between two points, and four of
them did not move at all. A locked-off camera is a legitimate choice exactly
once in a sequence; fourteen of them read as a turntable render. This module
builds the moves a camera operator would actually use, each one named for the
technique it is — the vocabulary is the standard one, and the names are worth
keeping because they say what the shot is *for*:

* **arc** — orbit a subject at fixed radius. Reveals form and separates the
  subject from its background by sliding the background past it.
* **dolly** — travel toward or away along the view axis. Changes intimacy
  without changing perspective.
* **truck** — travel laterally. Holds the subject and lets foreground and
  background shear apart, which is where parallax comes from.
* **pedestal / crane** — vertical travel. Turns a plan into an elevation.
* **tracking** — hold station relative to a moving subject, so the world moves
  and the subject does not.
* **pass-through** — the subject overtakes the camera, or the camera it. The
  only move that makes speed legible, because it puts something static in frame
  for the speed to be measured against.
* **dolly zoom** — dolly and zoom in opposition so the subject's screen size is
  held while its perspective is not. See :func:`dolly_zoom`; it has an exact
  invariant and a test that enforces it.
* **handheld** — additive low-frequency noise. Not a move, a texture applied
  over one.

Everything here is pure: a move takes a frame range and a callable that says
where the subject is, and returns keys. Nothing imports a host, so all of it is
checkable offline, which matters because a camera fault is invisible in code and
expensive in renders.

Two guards exist because both have already cost a shot in this project:
:func:`clamp_above` keeps a camera off the ground — a profiled terrain rose
1.61 m under a camera that used to clear a flat plane, and the whole cut
rendered as mud — and :func:`check_moves` refuses a camera sitting on its own
target, which yields an undefined view direction and a frame of garbage.

# a dolly, a vertical rise that reads as a reveal, an orbit that anticipates
# where the subject is going, a combined slide-and-zoom, a speed-controlled
# ramp, a push-in that closes distance without changing FOV, and the reverse —
# a pull-back that opens a scene up.
